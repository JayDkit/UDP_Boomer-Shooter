## About the Universal Design Project
Welcome to the GitHub repository of the GD3 team, King Collection’s Universal Design Project. This repository is used to store all project files and code related to the team’s game, Boomer Shooter, a first-person shooter game that implements bullet hell mechanics to create an intense and exciting gaming experience. The game is heavily influened by retro arcade shooters from the 90's, and so involves shooting and destroying turrets to earn a high score within the given time limit.
